# Z7 API (REST)
Z7 API is a REST API framework which runs on PHP. The project has been developed with PHP 7 on an apache http server. This has been a project I've been working on slowly when i have had time since 2016. The project was originally private for Zurvan-Labs, and it is currently running at https://api.zurvan-labs.net/. So why am I releasing this now? Honestly, I don't know if I will be working more on it, at least not for a while. So I'm uploading this as some kind of a showcase of some things I can do instead of letting it be private and forget about it.

The framework has alot of functionality and a already full featured authentication module which should work out of the box. The framework itself has a self-installation script for easy setup.

You can find installation documentation under the `docs` directory, with documentation of the authentication module. The code of the framework itself should be very well documented if you are interested in how it works.
